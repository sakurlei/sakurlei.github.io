<h1>Art</h1>
<pre> Art is a form of expressing youself through objects and colors. I heavily enjoy art. I always enjoyed it, even as a kid. <br>During elementary school, art was my favorite class to attent. But during middle school, I wasn't able to attend art in <br>7th or 8th grade. But when I was given the chance to attend this year, I jumped to it! I have been hyperfixating on art <br>recently, I even became the president of the art club! Art is an amazing wat to express your feelings or past to others <br>with our without words. </p><pre>Art has many means, from a hobby to a job. <i>Art will always be something I enjoy.</i></p>
